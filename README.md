# IoT-based-4-wheel-drive-Robot
The Project focus on making the IoT car robot using the nodemcu and it will allow to control the hardware using the Blynk Application. and Remotely it will be able to drive from any corner of the world.
The robot 4 wheel car is built using a NodeMCU ESP8266 for Wi-Fi connectivity and control, an L298N motor driver for driving the DC motors. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how IoT technology can be applied to robotics and vehicle automation.
components used 
NodeMCU ESP8266: Acts as the brain of the car, providing Wi-Fi connectivity and controlling motor operations.
L298N Motor Driver: Controls the speed and direction of the DC motors.
DC Motors: Used for moving the car forward, backward, left, and right.
Power Supply: A rechargeable battery to power the motors and electronics.
Working 
The NodeMCU is programmed using the Arduino IDE. It connects to a Wi-Fi network and communicates with the user through an IoT platform Blynk. Commands from the user are received by the NodeMCU, which then sends signals to the L298N motor driver to control the DC motors. This allows the car to move in different directions and at variable speeds based on the input.
